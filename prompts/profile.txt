<evaluation>
Primarily, you are to evaluate the following:
- Communication and clarity: A well-structured, concise resume suggests the candidate can organize thoughts clearly, which is a key soft skill.
- Leadership and collaboration: Phrases like "led a team" "collaborated with stakeholders" or "cross-functional coordination" indicate these soft skills in action.
- Initiative and problem-solving: Descriptions of how the candidate improved processes, launched new ideas, or solved issues signal proactivity and critical thinking.
- Professionalism: Proper grammar, consistency in formatting, and no typos show care, attention to detail, and pride in your work, which are all indicators of reliability.
- Cultural alignment: Volunteer work, passion projects, or personal values (e.g., sustainability, diversity) can hint at whether the candidate would be a good cultural fit.

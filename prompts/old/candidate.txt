You are to output the extracted file contents, which are details of the candidate.

If you are unable to find any file that matches with the name, meaning that we do not have the candidate details, output "Candidate name not found"
If you are unable to extract the contents of the file due to the file_extension (any file that is not in .txt, .docx, .pdf), output "File Extension not supported"
Else, you are to output only the extracted file contents

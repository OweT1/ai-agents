1. Experience
Hiring managers look for solid, relevant experience that shows you're prepared for the responsibilities of the role.

Relevance of past roles: Have you worked in similar positions or industries? If your past job titles and responsibilities closely match the new role, that’s a strong indicator of fit.

Career progression: They assess whether you’ve advanced over time — through promotions, increased responsibilities, or movement from junior to senior roles.

Quantifiable achievements: Metrics and results (e.g., "boosted sales by 25%", "reduced processing time by 40%") show that you made a real impact, not just performed routine tasks.

Industry or domain familiarity: Knowing the sector (e.g., healthcare, finance, tech) often makes onboarding easier and shows you understand industry-specific challenges.

2. Profile (Soft Skills & Professional Traits)
Your resume also reflects your personality and work style, even if subtly. Hiring managers infer these traits through both content and presentation.

Communication and clarity: A well-structured, concise resume suggests you can organize thoughts clearly — a key soft skill.

Leadership and collaboration: Phrases like “led a team,” “collaborated with stakeholders,” or “cross-functional coordination” indicate these soft skills in action.

Initiative and problem-solving: Descriptions of how you improved processes, launched new ideas, or solved issues signal proactivity and critical thinking.

Professionalism: Proper grammar, consistency in formatting, and no typos show care, attention to detail, and pride in your work — all indicators of reliability.

Cultural alignment: Volunteer work, passion projects, or personal values (e.g., sustainability, diversity) can hint at whether you'd be a good cultural fit.

3. Skills (Hard Skills & Technical Abilities)
Skills tell hiring managers whether you can perform the actual tasks required — especially for technical or specialized roles.

Job-relevant technical skills: These might include programming languages, tools (e.g., Excel, Figma, Salesforce), or domain-specific knowledge (e.g., accounting standards, data analysis).

Certifications and training: Formal credentials like AWS Certified Solutions Architect, CPA, or Google Analytics certification often provide extra credibility.

Proficiency levels: If listed (e.g., “Advanced Excel,” “Intermediate Python”), this helps hiring managers gauge whether you're ready to hit the ground running or need training.

Use of keywords: Especially for companies using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), including keywords from the job description ensures your resume is even seen by a human reviewer.

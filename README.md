Currently need to set up an `.env` file containing your `MISTRAL_API_KEY` which will be input into the `models.py` file for the Mistral models.

To get an API Key from Mistral, you will need to create an account and organisation, and get an API Key at https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys.

~~To get an API Key from Anthropic, you will need to create an account and get an API Key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys.~~
